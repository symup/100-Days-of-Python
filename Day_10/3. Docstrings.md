# Docstrings
- Def: A way for us to create little bits of documentation as we're coding along in our functions.
- Location: The first line after the declaration.
- """writing your documentation here!"""
Example:

def format_name(f_name, l_name):
    if f_name == "" or l_name == "":
        return "You didn't provide valid inputs."

    formated_f_name = f_name.title()
    formated_l_name = l_name.title()
    return f"{formated_f_name} {formated_l_name}"
