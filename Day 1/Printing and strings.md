# Debugging example
Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

      #1. Missing double quote
      print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")

      #2. Outer double quote change to single quote
      print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")

      #3. Extra indentation removed
        print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

      #4. Extra ( in print function removed
      print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

Fixed code

      print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
      print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
      print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
      print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
