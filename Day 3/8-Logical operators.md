# Logical Operators     

    A and B
    C or D 
    not E
    
## and operator
- Both A and B have to be true
- If A is true, B is false, then the overall thing evaluates to false.

      a = 12
      
      a > 10 and a < 13
      True
      
      a > 15 and a < 13
      False
      
## or operator
- if C or D were true, or they are both true, then it will evaluate to true.
- f only both C and D are false, this statement actually become false.

## not operator
- reverses a condition.

      a = 12
      not a > 15
      True
