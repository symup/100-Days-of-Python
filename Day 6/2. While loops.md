# While loops
###### The loop will continue going while a particular condition is true.

    while something_is_true:
      #Do something repeatedly
      
# For loops
###### Required: print item from lists, or range function.

    for item in list_of_items:
      #Do something to each item 
      
## while vs. for      
- Using a while loop when you don't really care what number in a seq you are in.
- While loops are a little bit more dangerous than For loops. Because:
- For loops: setting ahead of time how many times something is going to run.
- while loops: they will continue running until this particular condition switches to false.
 - If you have some sort of condition that actually never becomes false: it becomes an infinite loop.

Example of while loop:

    While not at_goal():
      jump()

    While at_goal() != true:
      jump()
  
# Infinite loop

    while 5 > 3:
      #Do this
      #Then do this
