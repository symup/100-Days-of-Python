# Dictionaries
- They allow us to group together and tag related pieces of infor.
- Form of a table.
- Every dictionary has 2 parts: Key & Value.

## 1. Syntax:

    {Key: Value}

    {Key1: Value1, Key2: Value2 , Key3: Value3}
    
###### Example:

    programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
        "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
        } #Definition for Bug and Function

    #Retrieving items from dictionary.
    print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])
    
###### output:

    An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.
    
    
## 2. Adding new items to dictionary

    programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
        "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
        } #Definition for Bug and Function

    #Adding new items to dictionary
    programming_dictionary["Loop"]="The action of doing somthing over and over again."
    print(programming_dictionary)
    
    #Tip: start out with a empty dictionary.
    empty_dictionary = {}
    #Then adding each item.

 ###### ouput:
 
     {'Bug': 'An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.', 
     'Function': 'A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.', 
     'Loop': 'The action of doing somthing over and over again.'}
 
 ## 3. Wipe an existing dictionary
 
     programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
        "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
        } 

    #Wipe an existing dictionary
    programming_dictionary = {}
    print(programming_dictionary)
    
###### ouput:

    {}
    
## 4. Edit an item in a dictionary

    programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
        "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
        } 

    #Edit an item in a dictionary 
    programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer."
    print(programming_dictionary)
    
 ###### output:
 
     {'Bug': 'A moth in your computer.', 'Function': 'A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.'}
     
## 5. Loop through a dictionary 

    programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
        "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
        } 

    #Loop through a dictionary 
    for key in programming_dictionary:
        print(key)
        print(programming_dictionary[key])
        
###### output:

    Bug
    An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.
    Function
    A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.
