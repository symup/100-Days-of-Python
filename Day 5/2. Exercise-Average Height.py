# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# e.g.
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†


#Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡

#total_height = sum(student_heights)
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  #total_height = total_height + height
  total_height += height
print(f"Total height = {total_height}")

#number_of_students = len(student_heights)
number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(f"Number of students = {number_of_students}")

average_height = round(total_height/number_of_students)
print(f"Average height is {average_height}")


OUTPUT:
  
  '''
Input a list of student heights 156 178 165 171 187
Total height = 857
Number of students = 5
Average height is 171
