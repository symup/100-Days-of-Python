# For loop

    for item in list_of_items:
        #Do something to each item

###### The loop allows us to execute the same line of code multiple times.

## Example

    fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Banana"]
    for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
      print(fruit + " Pie")
      
      
output

    Apple
    Apple Pie
    Peach
    Peach Pie
    Banana
    Banana Pie
