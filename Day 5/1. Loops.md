# For loop

    for item in list_of_items:
        #Do something to each item

###### The loop allows us to execute the same line of code multiple times.

## Example

    fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Banana"]
    for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
      
      
output

    Apple
    Peach
    Banana
